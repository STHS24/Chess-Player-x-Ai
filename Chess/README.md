## üîç Analysis Panel

The analysis panel shows:
- Current position evaluation
- Top moves considered by the engine
- Thinking time

Toggle it on/off with the 'A' key during gameplay.

## üìö Opening Book

The chess AI supports Polyglot opening books for stronger and more varied play in the opening phase.

### Downloading an Opening Book

Run the provided script to download a sample opening book:

```bash
python download_opening_book.py
```

This will download a Polyglot opening book file to the `chess_ai/books` directory.

### Using the Opening Book

- **In the GUI**: Press the 'B' key to toggle the opening book on/off
- **In the CLI**: Use the following commands:
  - `book on`: Enable the opening book
  - `book off`: Disable the opening book
  - `book status`: Show the current opening book status

When the opening book is enabled, the engine will use book moves for the opening phase of the game, resulting in more varied and stronger play.

## üíæ Position Caching

The chess AI uses a transposition table to cache position evaluations, significantly improving performance when positions are repeated or reached through different move orders.

### Using Position Caching

- **In the GUI**: Press the 'C' key to toggle position caching on/off
- **In the CLI**: Use the following commands:
  - `cache on`: Enable position caching
  - `cache off`: Disable position caching
  - `cache status`: Show cache statistics

Position caching is particularly effective in the middlegame and endgame, where the same positions are often evaluated multiple times during the search process.

## üß† Advanced Search

The chess AI uses alpha-beta pruning with move ordering to search more efficiently and play stronger moves.

### Using Advanced Search

- **In the GUI**: Press the 'S' key to toggle alpha-beta search on/off
- **In the CLI**: Use the following commands:
  - `search on`: Enable alpha-beta search
  - `search off`: Disable alpha-beta search (use simple search)
  - `search status`: Show search algorithm statistics

When alpha-beta search is enabled, the engine can look deeper into the position and find stronger moves. The search depth automatically adjusts based on the difficulty level.

## üéØ Tactical Awareness

The chess AI uses quiescence search to accurately evaluate tactical positions with captures and checks.

### Using Quiescence Search

- **In the GUI**: Press the 'Q' key to toggle quiescence search on/off
- **In the CLI**: Use the following commands:
  - `tactical on`: Enable quiescence search
  - `tactical off`: Disable quiescence search
  - `tactical status`: Show quiescence search statistics

Quiescence search prevents the "horizon effect" by continuing to search captures and checks beyond the regular search depth. This helps the engine avoid tactical blunders and find tactical opportunities.

## üöÄ Search Optimization

The chess AI uses null-move pruning to search deeper by skipping certain moves in positions where one side is likely ahead.

### Using Null-Move Pruning

- **In the GUI**: Press the 'N' key to toggle null-move pruning on/off
- **In the CLI**: Use the following commands:
  - `pruning on`: Enable null-move pruning
  - `pruning off`: Disable null-move pruning
  - `pruning status`: Show null-move pruning statistics

Null-move pruning significantly speeds up the search by allowing the engine to skip certain branches that are unlikely to be better than the current best move. This optimization is automatically disabled in endgame positions where it could lead to incorrect evaluations.

## üß† Machine Learning

The chess AI uses a simple machine learning system to adapt and improve its evaluation based on game results.

### Using Machine Learning

- **In the GUI**: Press the 'L' key to toggle the learning system on/off
- **In the CLI**: Use the following commands:
  - `learn on`: Enable the learning system
  - `learn off`: Disable the learning system
  - `learn status`: Show learning statistics
  - `result [1/0.5/0]`: Record a game result (1=white win, 0.5=draw, 0=black win)
  - `learn`: Process recorded positions and learn from the game

The learning system records positions during play and adjusts their evaluations based on game outcomes. Over time, the engine learns which positions lead to favorable results and improves its play accordingly. The system automatically saves learning data between sessions.

## üìä Positional Understanding

The chess AI uses advanced positional evaluation to make stronger moves beyond simple material counting.

### Using Positional Evaluation

- **In the GUI**: Press the 'P' key to toggle positional evaluation on/off
- **In the CLI**: Use the following commands:
  - `positional on`: Enable advanced positional evaluation
  - `positional off`: Disable advanced positional evaluation
  - `positional status`: Show positional evaluation status

When positional evaluation is enabled, the engine considers several important chess concepts:

- **Pawn Structure**: Evaluates isolated, doubled, backward, and passed pawns
- **King Safety**: Analyzes pawn shields and piece attacks near the king
- **Piece Mobility**: Counts the number of legal moves for each piece
- **Piece Coordination**: Evaluates bishop pairs, knights on outposts, and rooks on open files

These factors combine to give the engine a deeper understanding of chess positions, leading to stronger play.

## üìö Opening Repertoire

The chess AI features a sophisticated opening repertoire system with different playing styles and opening traps.

### Opening Styles

You can choose from four different opening styles:

- **Solid**: Conservative, defensive openings that prioritize safety and structure
- **Aggressive**: Attacking openings that seek tactical opportunities and piece activity
- **Tricky**: Surprising openings with potential traps to catch opponents off-guard
- **Balanced**: Standard, well-rounded openings suitable for all situations

### Using Opening Styles

- **In the GUI**: Press Ctrl+1 through Ctrl+4 to select a style (1=Solid, 2=Aggressive, 3=Tricky, 4=Balanced)
- **In the CLI**: Use the following commands:
  - `style solid`: Use solid, defensive opening repertoire
  - `style aggressive`: Use aggressive, attacking opening repertoire
  - `style tricky`: Use tricky, surprising opening repertoire with traps
  - `style balanced`: Use balanced, standard opening repertoire
  - `opening stats`: Show opening repertoire statistics

### Opening Traps

When using the 'tricky' style, the engine may employ opening traps like the Stafford Gambit, Fried Liver Attack, or Budapest Gambit to surprise opponents. These traps are also occasionally used in other styles.

### Adaptive Repertoire

The opening repertoire system learns from game results, gradually adjusting its preferences based on success rates. Openings that lead to wins are played more frequently, while unsuccessful lines are avoided.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

You can modify the following aspects of the game:

- **Board Size and Appearance**: Edit the constants in `chess_ai/config/settings.py`
- **Default Difficulty Level**: Change the `DEFAULT_DIFFICULTY` value in `chess_ai/config/settings.py`
- **AI Behavior**: Modify the evaluation functions in `chess_ai/engine/sunfish_wrapper.py`
- **Text Interface**: Customize the text display in `chess_ai/cli/text_interface.py`
