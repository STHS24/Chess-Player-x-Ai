- **Intelligent AI Opponent**: Play against the Sunfish chess engine with adjustable difficulty levels
- **Interactive GUI**: Clean, minimalist interface with black and gray board design
- **Customizable Experience**: Adjust difficulty, switch sides, and toggle analysis features
- **Real-time Analysis**: View the engine's evaluation and thinking process
- **Complete Chess Rules**: Full implementation of chess rules including castling, en passant, promotion, and game-ending conditions

*[Screenshots will be added soon]*

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Dependencies (automatically installed with instructions below):
  - pygame==2.5.2
  - python-chess==1.9.4

## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-ai-sunfish.git
cd chess-ai-sunfish

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Download ZIP

1. Download the ZIP file from the GitHub repository
2. Extract the contents to a folder of your choice
3. Open a command prompt or terminal in that folder
4. Follow the dependency installation steps above

## üöÄ How to Play

1. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. **Game Controls**:
   - **Mouse**: Click on a piece to select it, then click on a destination square to move
   - **R key**: Reset the game
   - **S key**: Switch sides (play as black or white)
   - **Number keys 1-9**: Adjust difficulty (1 is easiest, 9 is hardest)
   - **A key**: Toggle the analysis panel

3. The game automatically detects checkmate, stalemate, and other game-ending conditions.

## üîç Analysis Panel

The analysis panel shows:
- Current position evaluation
- Top moves considered by the engine
- Thinking time

Toggle it on/off with the 'A' key during gameplay.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

You can modify the following aspects of the game:

- **Board Size and Appearance**: Edit the constants at the top of `main.py`
- **Default Difficulty Level**: Change the `engine.set_difficulty()` value in `main.py`
- **AI Behavior**: Modify the evaluation functions in `sunfish_wrapper.py`

## üß™ Testing

To verify that your installation is working correctly, run the test script:

```bash
python test_installation.py
```

This script will check:
- If all required dependencies are installed
- If all necessary files are present
- If the chess engine can be initialized

Once the test passes, you can run the game and test it manually:

```bash
# Run the game
python main.py

# Try making moves and using keyboard controls
# Test different difficulty levels
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Game doesn't start**:
   - Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
   - Verify all dependencies are installed with `pip list`
   - Check console for error messages

2. **Graphics issues**:
   - Update your graphics drivers
   - Try running in a window rather than fullscreen

3. **Engine errors**:
   - Make sure `sunfish.py` is in the project directory
   - Check that the file permissions allow execution
