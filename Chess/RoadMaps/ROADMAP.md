# Chess AI Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development plan for creating a chess AI bot. It follows established approaches and best practices from existing implementations.

> **Update**: After encountering compatibility issues with Stockfish, we've switched to using a custom chess engine inspired by Sunfish concepts.

## Phase 1: Setup and Foundation (1-2 weeks)
1. **Environment Setup**
   - [x] Install Python (3.8+ recommended)
   - [x] Install required libraries: `python-chess`, `pygame`
   - [x] Configure chess engine integration
   - [ ] Set up version control (Git)

2. **Basic Chess Board Representation**
   - [x] Implement using `python-chess` library
   - [x] Create functions to display the board state
   - [x] Implement basic game state tracking (checkmate, stalemate, etc.)

3. **Chess Engine Integration**
   - [x] Create a wrapper for the chess engine
   - [x] Implement move generation and evaluation
   - [x] Test basic move generation
   - [x] Implement error handling for engine initialization failures

## Phase 2: Core Functionality (2-3 weeks)
1. **Move Generation and Validation**
   - [x] Implement legal move generation using `python-chess`
   - [x] Create functions to validate user moves
   - [x] Implement special moves (castling, en passant, promotion)

2. **Game State Management**
   - [x] Track game history and move sequences
   - [x] Implement FEN notation for board positions
   - [ ] Create save/load game functionality

3. **Chess Engine Configuration**
   - [x] Implement difficulty levels
   - [x] Configure analysis depth and thinking time
   - [x] Implement position evaluation
   - [x] Create fallback mechanisms for engine failures

## Phase 3: User Interface (2-3 weeks)
1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
   - [ ] Create a simple text-based interface for testing
   - [ ] Implement commands for making moves and viewing the board
   - [ ] Add help and information commands

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
   - [x] Choose a GUI framework (Pygame)
   - [x] Design the chessboard display with black and gray colors
   - [x] Implement click-based piece movement
   - [x] Add visual indicators for legal moves, checks, etc.
   - [x] Create a compact, smaller interface

3. **Game Controls**
   - [x] Implement new game, reset game functionality
   - [ ] Add load game, save game capabilities
   - [ ] Add undo/redo move capabilities
   - [x] Create settings for engine configuration (difficulty levels)

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (3-4 weeks)
1. **AI Difficulty Levels**
   - [x] Implement multiple difficulty settings
   - [x] Configure engine parameters for each level
   - [x] Implement randomness based on difficulty level
   - [ ] Add time controls for the AI

2. **Game Analysis**
   - [x] Implement move evaluation and suggestions
   - [x] Display engine's decision-making process
   - [x] Add visualization of alternative moves
   - [x] Create an analysis panel with real-time updates

3. **Opening Book Integration**
   - [ ] Implement Polyglot opening book support
   - [ ] Create functions to use opening books for early game moves
   - [ ] Add variety to AI play style

4. **PGN Support**
   - [ ] Implement PGN import/export functionality
   - [ ] Create game notation display
   - [ ] Add annotation capabilities

## Phase 5: Testing and Refinement (2-3 weeks)
1. **Testing**
   - [ ] Create unit tests for core functionality
   - [ ] Perform integration testing with the chess engine
   - [ ] Conduct user testing for the interface

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Optimize engine communication
   - [x] Improve rendering performance
   - [x] Reduce memory usage with compact UI

3. **Bug Fixing and Refinement**
   - [x] Address compatibility issues with chess engines
   - [x] Refine user interface based on feedback
   - [x] Implement comprehensive error handling
   - [x] Create fallback systems for component failures

## Phase 6: Documentation and Deployment (1-2 weeks)
1. **Documentation**
   - [x] Create basic README
   - [ ] Expand user manual with detailed instructions
   - [ ] Document code with comprehensive comments and docstrings

2. **Packaging**
   - [ ] Create an executable package
   - [ ] Set up proper dependency management
   - [ ] Prepare for distribution

3. **Final Testing and Release**
   - [ ] Perform final testing across different environments
   - [ ] Create release version
   - [ ] Publish project

## Next Steps

Based on the current implementation, the following tasks should be prioritized:

1. Implement save/load game functionality
2. Add undo/redo move capabilities
3. Create a command-line interface for alternative access
4. Implement opening book integration for more varied gameplay
5. Add PGN support for game analysis and sharing
6. Improve the chess engine's evaluation function
7. Add more sophisticated analysis features
8. Create unit tests for core functionality
