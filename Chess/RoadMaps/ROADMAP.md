# Chess AI Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development plan for creating a chess AI bot. It follows established approaches and best practices from existing implementations.

> **Update**: After encountering compatibility issues with Stockfish, we've switched to using a custom chess engine inspired by Sunfish concepts.
>
> **New**: For a detailed roadmap specifically focused on enhancing the AI opponent, see [AI_BOT_ROADMAP.md](AI_BOT_ROADMAP.md)
