## Technical Implementation Notes

### Transposition Tables
Transposition tables will store previously evaluated positions to avoid redundant calculations. Implementation will use Zobrist hashing for efficient position identification.

### AI Personalities
Each personality will have different evaluation weights:
- **Aggressive**: Higher values for attacking pieces, lower values for defensive structures
- **Defensive**: Prioritize king safety and pawn structure
- **Balanced**: Standard evaluation with slight randomization

### Search Algorithms
The alpha-beta pruning implementation significantly improves search depth by eliminating branches that won't affect the final decision. Move ordering prioritizes captures, checks, and promotions to maximize pruning efficiency. Iterative deepening ensures the engine always has a valid move to return, even if interrupted.

Quiescence search extends the search at leaf nodes for captures and checks, preventing the horizon effect and improving tactical awareness. This helps the engine avoid tactical blunders and find tactical opportunities that would otherwise be missed.

Null-move pruning allows the engine to skip certain moves in positions where one side is likely ahead, significantly speeding up the search. This optimization is automatically disabled in endgame positions where it could lead to incorrect evaluations.

### Evaluation Function
The evaluation function considers material balance, piece-square tables, pawn structure, king safety, and mobility. This gives the engine a more nuanced understanding of chess positions. The positional evaluator analyzes isolated, doubled, and passed pawns, checks for pawn shields around the king, counts piece mobility, and recognizes strategic elements like bishop pairs and rooks on open files.

### Opening Repertoire
The opening repertoire system provides different playing styles (solid, aggressive, tricky, and balanced) with weighted move selection based on past success. It includes opening traps like the Stafford Gambit and Fried Liver Attack to surprise opponents. The system learns from game results, adjusting weights for openings that lead to favorable outcomes.

### Learning System
The learning system maintains a database of positions and outcomes, gradually adjusting position evaluations based on game results. It stores positions encountered during play and modifies their evaluations based on the final game result. This allows the engine to improve over time and adapt to different playing styles. The system uses a simple form of supervised learning with a sigmoid function to map evaluations to expected results.
